# Resume Matching Algorithms Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the resume scoring logic for two different matching systems: the **Extension Algorithm** and the **Web App Algorithm**. Both systems use OpenAI's GPT models but with different approaches, prompts, and scoring methodologies.

---

## üîç Extension Algorithm

### **Model & Approach**
- **Model**: GPT-4o (More powerful and contextual)
- **Approach**: Holistic single-pass analysis
- **Score Range**: 0-100 (Harsh grading scale)
- **Analysis Type**: Interpretive matrix breakdown

### **Scoring Criteria**
The Extension uses a strict ATS-style scoring system with the following bands:

| Score Range | Classification | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 90-100 | Perfect match | Candidate exceeds ALL requirements |
| 80-89 | Excellent match | Meets ALL requirements with some extras |
| 70-79 | Good match | Meets MOST requirements with minor gaps |
| 60-69 | Moderate match | Meets SOME requirements with notable gaps |
| 50-59 | Weak match | Few requirements met, significant gaps |
| 0-49 | Poor match | Fundamental misalignment, major gaps |

### **Evaluation Process**
1. **Technical Skills Analysis**: Count specific technical skills mentioned in job vs resume
2. **Experience Evaluation**: Compare years of experience required vs actual
3. **Education/Certification Check**: Verify education/certification requirements
4. **Industry/Domain Alignment**: Assess industry and domain experience match
5. **Seniority Level Assessment**: Evaluate if candidate's level matches job requirements

### **Output Format**
```json
{
  "overallScore": 85,
  "strengths": ["Specific matching skills/experience found"],
  "gaps": ["Specific missing requirements"],
  "recommendations": ["Concrete actionable advice"],
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of score calculation",
  "matrix": [
    {
      "category": "Technical Skills",
      "requirement": "Python programming, 5+ years",
      "evidence": "Python developer with 3 years experience",
      "matchLevel": "partial",
      "gapAction": "Highlight advanced Python projects to demonstrate deeper expertise"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Exact Prompt Used**
```
You are a strict ATS system that provides brutally honest job-resume matching scores. Be very discriminating and use the full 0-100 scale.

SCORING CRITERIA:
- 90-100: Perfect match - candidate exceeds ALL requirements
- 80-89: Excellent match - meets ALL requirements with some extras
- 70-79: Good match - meets MOST requirements with minor gaps
- 60-69: Moderate match - meets SOME requirements with notable gaps
- 50-59: Weak match - few requirements met, significant gaps
- 0-49: Poor match - fundamental misalignment, major gaps

JOB POSTING:
Title: [Job Title]
Company: [Company]
Description: [Job Description]

RESUME:
[Resume Content]

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Count specific technical skills mentioned in job vs resume
2. Evaluate years of experience required vs actual
3. Check for education/certification requirements
4. Look for industry/domain experience alignment
5. Assess seniority level match

Be harsh but fair. Don't give sympathy scores. If there are major gaps, reflect this in a low score. Most candidates should score below 70 unless they're truly exceptional matches. Use the full range from 0-100.

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.

## üîç Web App Algorithm

### **Model & Approach**
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (Faster and more cost-effective)
- **Approach**: Evidence-based variable scoring with exact text matching
- **Score Range**: 0-90 (Weighted scoring system)
- **Analysis Type**: Precise evidence tracking with character offsets

### **Global Weights System**
The Web App uses a weighted scoring system with the following distribution:

| Variable | Weight | Percentage |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Technical Skills | 28 points | 31.1% |
| Experience Level | 18 points | 20.0% |
| Job Functions | 15 points | 16.7% |
| Industry Experience | 10 points | 11.1% |
| Certifications | 7 points | 7.8% |
| Education Requirements | 7 points | 7.8% |
| Soft Skills | 5 points | 5.6% |
| **Total** | **90 points** | **100%** |

### **Criticality Multipliers**
- **must_have**: 1.0x weight (Critical requirements)
- **strong_preference**: 0.7x weight (Important but not critical)
- **nice_to_have**: 0.4x weight (Bonus qualifications)

### **Scoring Rules**
1. **Evidence Requirement**: Only use EXACT text from r√©sum√© as evidence
2. **Character Offsets**: Track exact location of evidence in resume text
3. **Match Scoring**: Rate evidence quality from 0.0 to 1.0
4. **No Inference**: Never infer or assume evidence not explicitly stated
5. **Points Calculation**: `requirement_points = weight √ó crit_bonus √ó match_score`

### **Thresholds**
- **Auto-pass Overall**: ‚â•75 points
- **Must-have Minimum**: ‚â•0.70 match score for all must_have requirements
- **Review Status**: Assigned if any must_have < 0.70 or overall < 75

### **Output Format**
```json
{
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "Experience Level",
      "details": [
        {
          "jd_text": "6+ years corporate law experience",
          "resume_evidence": "8+ years of corporate law experience",
          "offsets": "180-245",
          "criticality": "must_have",
          "match_score": 0.93
        }
      ],
      "variable_score": 16.7
    }
  ],
  "overall_weighted_score": 80.2,
  "status": "autopass"
}
```

GLOBAL_WEIGHTS (sum = 90)  
Technical 28 ‚Ä¢ Job Functions 15 ‚Ä¢ Experience 18 ‚Ä¢ Industry 10 ‚Ä¢ Certifications 7  
Education 7 ‚Ä¢ Soft Skills 5

THRESHOLDS  
micro_score_min_for_must_have = 0.70  
auto_pass_overall = 75

RULES
1. For every requirement in the job description, search for EXACT EVIDENCE in the r√©sum√© text.  
2. ONLY return evidence that EXISTS VERBATIM in the r√©sum√©. DO NOT infer, assume, or create evidence.  
3. If you find exact text that matches the requirement:  
   - Copy the EXACT text from r√©sum√© as resume_evidence  
   - Provide the character offsets where this text appears  
   - Score based on how well the exact text matches the requirement (0.0-1.0)  
4. If you find NO exact evidence in the r√©sum√©:  
   - Set resume_evidence = ""  
   - Set offsets = ""  
   - Set match_score = 0.0

JOB DESCRIPTION:
Title: [Job Title]
Company: [Company]
Description: [Job Description]

RESUME_TEXT_WITH_OFFSETS:

CRITICAL: resume_evidence must be EXACT text from the r√©sum√©. DO NOT create or infer evidence.
