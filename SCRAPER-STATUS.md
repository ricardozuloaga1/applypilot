### **Root Causes:**
- Job sites frequently update their HTML structure
- Increased anti-bot measures on major job boards
- Current selectors may be outdated
- Need better fallback selector strategies

## 🛠️ **Improvement Plan**

### **Phase 1: Diagnostic & Analysis** ✅
- [x] Created diagnostic script (`debug-scrapers.js`)
- [x] Identified selector accuracy issues
- [x] Documented current performance levels

### **Phase 2: Selector Updates** (Next Priority)
- [ ] Run diagnostic script to identify working selectors
- [ ] Update Indeed selectors based on current site structure
- [ ] Add multiple fallback selectors for each data field
- [ ] Implement retry logic with different extraction methods

### **Phase 3: Alternative Approaches**
- [ ] Add more API-based sources (AngelList, Dice, ZipRecruiter APIs)
- [ ] Implement residential proxy rotation
- [ ] Add request throttling and better stealth measures
- [ ] Consider paid scraping services for production

### **Phase 4: Quality Assurance**
- [ ] Implement data validation to detect placeholder content
- [ ] Add quality scoring for scraped jobs
- [ ] Filter out low-quality results automatically
- [ ] Improve fallback to mock data when real data unavailable
