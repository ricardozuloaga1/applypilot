You are an expert HR analyst with extensive experience across multiple industries. I need you to complete two tasks:

**TASK 1: Identify Universal Job Requirements**
Analyze typical job descriptions and identify the 20-30 most common requirements that appear across industries. Categorize them into these weighted categories:

• CRITICAL_REQUIREMENTS (40% weight) - Essential requirements commonly mentioned
• CORE_COMPETENCIES (35% weight) - Skills and abilities frequently required  
• EXPERIENCE_FACTORS (15% weight) - Experience-related requirements that commonly appear
• PREFERRED_QUALIFICATIONS (10% weight) - Nice-to-have qualifications that frequently appear

For each variable, provide:
- Name
- Category
- Frequency percentage
- Description
- Common phrases used in job postings

**TASK 2: Generate a Catch-All Extraction Prompt**
Create a comprehensive prompt that can extract job-specific requirements that are NOT covered by the universal variables you identified. This prompt should:

1. Take a job description as input
2. Identify job-specific requirements not covered by universal variables
3. Extract unique industry-specific, company-specific, or role-specific requirements
4. Ensure no duplication with universal variables
5. Maintain evidence-based extraction (only what's explicitly mentioned)
6. Categorize findings into the same 4 categories with weights
7. Provide evidence from job posting for each extracted variable

**TASK 3: Implementation Strategy**
Explain how this two-part system (universal + dynamic variables) would work in practice, including:
- How to combine both sets without duplication
- How to weight universal vs dynamic variables
- Quality control measures
- Expected benefits

Please provide detailed analysis and the requested catch-all prompt that can be implemented immediately.
